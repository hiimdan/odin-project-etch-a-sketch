- Build your sketchpad by choosing a square grid of boxes that can range from 1 to 10000 boxes, depending on whatever you choose as the number of boxes per side. 

- Choose from two different color modes, black and white, or multi-color to color your grid by clicking or clicking and dragging across the grid. Multi-color mode allows you to darken the hue by 10% each time you re-activate that grid item.

- Erase individual grid items by clicking or clicking and dragging using the secondary mouse button, or alternatively you can reset the entire grid by just clicking the "reset" button.
